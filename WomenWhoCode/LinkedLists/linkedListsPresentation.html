				<section><!-- slide 2 -->
					<p class="alterconf">Linked lists are very minimalistic data structures</p>
					<p class="alterconf">A linked list is a set of nodes, each of which has a reference to the next node.</p>
					<p class="alterconf">All we "know" about a linked list is its head node.</p>
					<p class="alterconf">On the left is C# or Java definition of a node that contains an integer value. On the right there is a Javascript definition.</p>

<pre><code class="linkedList">
				  <div style="float: left">
public class ListNode {
       int value;
       ListNode nextNode;
}
</div>
				  <div style="float: right">
function ListNode(value, nextNode) {
	this.storedValue = value;
	this.nextNode = nextNode;
}
	</div>
</code></pre>

				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 3 -->
					<p class="alterconf">Linked lists can be understood recursively:</p>
					<p class="alterconf">A list is its head node followed by a linked list.</p>
					<p class="alterconf">Many linked list operations can be written recursively, but for now we'll implement them non-recursively.</p>
					<h4 class="alterconf">Exercise 1: create a linked list.</h4>
					<p class="alterconf">Create 4 ListNode objects, each of which has a reference to the next one, and contains an integer value.</p>
				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 4 -->
					<h4>Exercise 2. Write out the list.</h4>
					<p class="alterconf">Write a function that takes the head node as an argument, and writes out the values of all the nodes in the list.</p>
					<p class="alterconf">Left: C# or Java; right: Javascript.</p>

<pre><code class="linkedList">
				  <div style="float: left">
public void writeOutAllNodes(ListNode headNode) {
	// Your code
}
</div>
				  <div style="float: right">
function writeOutAllNodes(headNode) {
	// Your code
}
	</div>
</code></pre>

				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 5 -->
					<h4 class="alterconf">Exercise 3. Insert a node at the beginning of the list.</h4>
					<p class="alterconf-left">Write a function that takes the head node of the list and an integer value, creates a new node with that value, prepends it before the head node, and returns the head node of the resulting list.</p>
					<p class="alterconf">Left: C# or Java; right: Javascript.</p>

<pre><code class="linkedList">
				  <div style="float: left">
public ListNode insertAtBeginning(
	ListNode headNode, int value) {
	// Your code
}
</div>
				  <div style="float: right">
function insertAtBeginning(headNode, value) {
	// Your code
}
	</div>
</code></pre>
				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 6 -->
					<h4 class="alterconf">Exercise 3. Append a node at the end of the list.</h4>
					<p class="alterconf-left">Write a function that takes the head node of the list and an integer value, creates a new node with that value, appends it after the last node, and returns the head node of the resulting list.</p>
<pre><code class="linkedList">
				  <div style="float: left">
public ListNode insertAtEnd(
	ListNode headNode, int value) {
	// Your code
}
</div>
				  <div style="float: right">
function insertAtEnd(headNode, value) {
	// Your code
}
	</div>
</code></pre>
			<p class="alterconf-left"><b>What possible error conditions should you check for in this function?</b></p>
				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 7 -->
					<h4 class="alterconf">Exercise 4. Insert a node into linked list at a given position.</h4>
					<p class="alterconf-left">Write a function that takes the head node of the list, an integer value, and an integer position, creates a new node with that value, inserts it in the list at the given position, and returns the head node of the resulting list. </p>
<pre><code class="linkedList">
				  <div style="float: left">
public ListNode insertAtPosition(
	ListNode headNode, int value,
	int position) {
	// Your code
}
</div>
				  <div style="float: right">
function insertAtPosition(headNode, 
	value, position) {
	// Your code
}
	</div>

					<h3>What if you didn't play those hierarchical games?</h3>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">If you are a woman, you are probably not overconfident.</p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">Your confidence level accurately reflects what you can/cannot do. </p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">If you are new to the company (even experienced developer) you know how much you don't know. </p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">You don't know the company's codebase, their products, the business reasons. </p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">It's natural to not be overconfident. </p>
					<p>

						<aside class="notes">
<p>But suppose you are a woman, and you never played these types of games on the playground with boys. And it shouldn't be necessary: that's not what makes an effective software developer. Also, you are likely not overconfident. You probably have an accurate measure of your abilities and skills, of what you can and cannot do. You are new to the organization, and no matter how experienced a programmer you are, you don't know this particular company's codebase, you don't know its business rules, or what the customers want. You realize how easy it is to break the code in a catastrophic way and put the company's livelihood at risk. So for you it seems completely reasonable to move with caution and learn as much as you can about this company's code specifics before you claim leadership or ownership of some project. When you are new to a company, it is smart and reasonable to not be overconfident.</p>

					<h3>Clear ramp-up path</h3>
					<p>
					<h4><b>Identify beginner-friendly bugs</b></h4>	
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li class="alterconf">Not super-urgent -- can take 1-2 weeks to complete; </li>
						<li class="alterconf">Not too critical to the customer -- can be used for a new hire ramp-up; </li>
						<li class="alterconf">Cover many code areas - give the new hire a tour of application functionality. </li>
					</ul>
					<p class="alterconf">I guarantee every company has those kinds of bugs. </p>
						<aside class="notes">
<p>Have a clear ramp-up path for new hires. </p>

<p>One path would be letting the new hires fix bugs first. But this has to be structured with some thought.</p>

<p>Management and senior developers need to review the bugs in your bug-tracking system, and identify those that are beginner-friendly --  not just to junior developers, but to any new hire, even experienced one. By that I don't mean technically easy -- I mean this: </p>

<p>(1) not super-urgent or too critical to the customer -- can take 1-2 weeks to complete, and you won't lose a customer if it is implemented imperfectly; <p>

<p>(2) the ones that don't depend on requirements that are not fully hashed-out yet; bugs that are not a point of contention between developers and product management; bugs where a technical glitch doesn't actually mask ambiguity or undocumented change in business rules. If the requirements are not clear, and the new developer does not yet know your company's product to have an opinion how some functionality should behave, what are the underlying business rules that would make one solution or another more logical, most likely a new developer would stall, even if a more experienced one knows how to work informally with the product management, what ropes to pull to figure this out.</p>

<p>(3) This collection of beginner-friendly bugs (it will constantly change as the bugs get fixed and new ones appear, but still) should cover various areas of the codebase. It should give the new hire a tour of the codebase, so the he or she could later contribute to a wide variety of proejcts.</p>

<p>I guarantee every company has those kinds of bugs.</p>

				<section><!-- slide 11 -->
					<h4><b>Have some starter projects</b></h4>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">In every project, identify parts that could be done by a new hire.</p>
					<ul>
					<li class="alterconf">projects that have clear-cut requirements</li> 
					<li class="alterconf">projects that don't rely on unspoken/unwritten business knowledge</li>
					<li class="alterconf">projects where it's not very easy to break the existing functionality</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="alterconf-left">It means managers and senior developers have to think through it. </p>
					<p class="alterconf-left">It takes time, but it's better than keeping a developer idle and unable to make progress. </p>
						<aside class="notes">
<p>Same for new development projects.</p>

<p>In every project, identify parts that could be done by a new hire, such as: projects that have clear-cut requirements, projects that don't rely on unspoken or unwritten business knowledge, projects where it's not very easy to accidentally break the existing codebase.</p>

<p>It means managers and senior developers have to think through it. That takes time. But it's better than keeping a developer idle and unable to make progress, and eventually leaving the company. It also means that your team will be more than just people who are good at playing power games. So you'll have a more diverse team.</p>
