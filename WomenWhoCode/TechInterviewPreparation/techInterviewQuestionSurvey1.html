					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p class="sixty-percent-left">This is a sample of interview questions that you might get about Javascript and some object-oriented languages, if you are looking for an application developer or a web developer position. </b></p>
					<p class="sixty-percent-left">If you work in a specialized field of computing, such as systems programming, firmware, drivers, scientific computing, data science, or other specialization, these questions might not reflect what you can expect an an interview.</p>

					<p class="sixty-percent-left">In many programming interviews, writing code to solve a problem (on a whiteboard or a computer) is only a small part of the interview. Algorithms are often only a small part. The bulk of the interview will probably be answering questions about specific features of the programming language requiring for the job, writing code that demonstrates your knowledge of that language, also answering questions about software engineering, architecture, design, and best practices.</p>

				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 2 -->
					<h3>The purpose of this presentation</h3>
   <blockquote class="presentation">All of the questions here are only starting points for your study. The answers provided here are by no means complete or exhaustive. Rather, they point you in the direction you should look into for understanding the given topic.
   </blockquote>

   <blockquote class="presentation">It will be useful to work through the code examples provided here, and in the websites that are linked to in this presentation. In addition to that, try to come up with your own code samples that illustrate these problems.
   </blockquote>

				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 4 -->

					<p class="sixty-percent-left">More and more development positions are full-stack, and they require some knowledge of Javascript. If the position you are applying to is for developing an application that has a web front, chances are the employer will expect you to know at least some Javascript.</p>
					<p class="sixty-percent-left">So unless you are applying for positions that are strictly server-side development (there aren't many of those), it's good to know Javascript.</p>
					<p class="sixty-percent-left">Many times the interviewer will show you code snippets, and ask what the snippet would print, like in the following pages of this presentation.</p>
				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 4 -->
				<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 1. <code>null</code> vs <code>undefined</code></h4>
					
   <blockquote class="presentation">Difference between null and undefined values?
   </blockquote>
   <p class="alterconf">Null is a value, but undefined is a type.</p> 

<div class="card-columns presentation">
    <div class="card card-block presentation">
      <h4 class="card-title presentation">Variable declared, but not assigned</h4>
      <p class="card-text presentation"><code>var a;</code></p>
      <p class="card-text presentation">What will <code>console.log(a);</code> print?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card card-block presentation">
      <h4 class="card-title presentation">Reference a field object doesn't have:</h4>
	 <p class="card-text presentation">
	<pre><code class="presentation-bigger">
var pet = {
  name: "Fluffy", 
  breed: "Cat"
};
</code></pre>
	 <p class="card-text presentation">What will <code>console.log(pet.age);</code> print? </p> 
    </div>
    <div class="card card-block presentation">
      <h4 class="card-title presentation">If the <code>pet</code> object is created with this constructor:</h4>
	 <p class="card-text presentation">
	<pre><code class="presentation-bigger">
function Pet(name, breed) {
	this.name = name;
	this.breed = breed;
};
</code></pre>
	 <p class="card-text presentation">then you call the constructor as </p> 
	 <p class="card-text presentation"><code>var pet = new Pet("Fluffy")</code> </p> 
	 <p class="card-text presentation">What will <code>console.log(pet.breed);</code> print? </p> 
    </div>
</div>

					<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 2. Variable scopes</h4>

   <blockquote class="presentation">What is a global variable in Javascript?</blockquote>

   <p class="alterconf">A variable whose scope is the window the script runs in.</p> 

   <blockquote class="presentation">How do you make variable global?</blockquote>

   <p class="alterconf">If you don't declare it with <code>var</code>, it will be global.</p> 

   <blockquote class="presentation">What is a local variable?</blockquote>

   <p class="alterconf">A variable declared with a <code>var</code> keyword is local to the scope it is declared in, such as a function.</p> 

   <blockquote class="presentation">Are global variables good? Why or why not?</blockquote>

   <p class="alterconf">They should be avoided. A global variable is easy to modify accidentally. When all parts of your code are modifying the same variable, it becomes difficult to reason about what its value should be at a given point. Always declare the variables in the scope you need them in.</p> 

				</section>


				<section><!-- slide 6 -->

					<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 3.</h4>

   <blockquote class="presentation">What is the difference between == and === operators?</blockquote>

   <p class="alterconf">== operator only checks the values of the operands, but === also checks types.</p> 

	<pre><code class="presentation-bigger">
	var a1 = 5;
	var a2 = "5";
	console.log(a1 == a2); // true;
	console.log(a1 === a2); // false;
	</code></pre>

   <blockquote class="presentation">What does <code>this</code> keyword mean? </blockquote>

   <p class="alterconf"><code>this</code> refers to an object that can be different things depending on the context. </p> 

      <p class="alterconf"><code>this</code> as the global object (window)</p>
      <p class="alterconf"><code>console.log(this === window); // true</code></p>
      <p class="alterconf"><code>console.log(this.document === document); // true</code></p>


				</section>


				<section><!-- slide 7 -->

	<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 4. <code>this</code> inside a function</h4>

	 <p class="alterconf">Constructor for <code>Employee</code> object: </p> 
	<pre><code class="presentation-bigger">
function Employee(empName, empDept, empjobTitle) {
 this.name = empName;
 this.department = empDept;
 this.jobTitle = empjobTitle;
 console.log(this.name + ", " + this.department + " " + this.jobTitle);
}
var emp1 = Employee("Foo", "Engineering", "Developer");
console.log(this.name + ", " + this.department + " " + this.jobTitle);
</code></pre>
	 <p class="alterconf">Let's call it as just a function, not a constructor: </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf"><code>var emp1 = Employee("Foo", "Engineering", "Developer")</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">It will print <code>"Foo, Engineering, Developer"</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">What if we call the same <code>console.log</code> statement outside the function? </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf"><code>console.log(this.name + ", " + this.department + " " + this.jobTitle);</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">It prints the same: <code>"Foo, Engineering, Developer"</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">That tells us that <code>this</code> inside <code>Employee()</code> function was the global <code>this</code> (window). </p> 

				</section>
				<section><!-- slide 8 -->
	<pre><code class="presentation">
function Employee(empName, empDept, empjobTitle) {
 this.name = empName;
 this.department = empDept,
 this.jobTitle = empjobTitle;
 console.log(this.name + ", " + this.department + " " + this.jobTitle);
}
var emp2 = Employee("Baz", "Implementations", "Implementations Engineer");
console.log(this.name + ", " + this.department + " " + this.jobTitle);
</code></pre>

	 <p class="alterconf">Now let's call <code>Employee()</code> as a constructor: </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf"><code>var emp2 = new Employee("Baz", "Implementations", "Implementations Engineer")</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">The difference is, we are calling it with a <code>new</code> keyword, so it constructs an <code>Employee</code> object. </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">It will print <code>"Baz, Implementations, Implementations Engineer"</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">What if we call the same <code>console.log</code> statement outside the function? </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf"><code>console.log(this.name + ", " + this.department + " " + this.jobTitle);</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">It prints, as before <code>"Foo, Engineering, Developer"</code> </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf"><code>this</code> inside the Employee object is now different from the global <code>this</code>. </p> 
	 <p class="alterconf">Constructing an Employee object caused <code>this</code> inside the object to refer to the object itself. </p> 
				</section>


				<section><!-- slide 9 -->


				<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 5. <code>bind, call, apply</code> </h4>

   				<p class="alterconf">A general rule is that <code>this</code> in the context of an object (e.g. if a function is called off of an object) will refer to the object itself, while outside of any object it will be the "global" <code>this</code> (usually the browser window). But there are many more nuances in the use of <code>this</code>. Be sure to study them all. A good reference is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this. </p> 

   				<p class="alterconf">As we see, <code>this</code> can refer to different objects, and it can be confusing. </p> 

   				<blockquote class="presentation">How do you use Javascript special functions <code>bind, call, apply</code> so that <code>this</code> would always be the object you need? </blockquote>

   				<blockquote class="presentation">How do you do it with arrow functions in ES6? </blockquote>


				</section>


				<section><!-- slide 10 -->

				<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 6. More Javascript development questions</h4>

   				<blockquote class="presentation">What kind of inheritance model Javascript uses?</blockquote>

   				<p class="alterconf">Prototypal / prototype-based inheritance.</p> 

   				<blockquote class="presentation">How is it different from class-based inheritance?</blockquote>

		   		<blockquote class="presentation">Does Javascript have private variables (like many class-based languages)?</blockquote>
		   		
   				<p class="alterconf">No, it doesn't.</p> 	
   				
				<blockquote class="presentation">Can you emulate private fields and methods in Javascript?</blockquote>
				
				<p class="alterconf">Yes, you can. One way to do it would be with Module Pattern: https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern using IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression) and closures. Study this article to understand uses of closures and IIFE. </p>
				
				<blockquote class="presentation">How do you create namespaces in Javascript?</blockquote>
				
				<p class="alterconf">To keep the variable names from colliding (especially if your Javascript code has to coexist with third-party Javascript libraries) you can create a namespace for your code. Many ways of creating namespaces use IIFE. You can read about namespacing patterns here: https://addyosmani.com/blog/essential-js-namespacing </p>

				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 11 -->

				<h4 class="alterconf">Javascript questions 7. </h4>

   				<blockquote class="presentation">What are closures? What are they used for? Write a code snippet that demonstrates the use of a closure.</blockquote>

   				<blockquote class="presentation">What is IIFE (immediately-invoked function expression)? What is it used for?</blockquote>

<p class="alterconf">One possible answer is in the previous page. In general, they are used to create a scope.</p>

   				<blockquote class="presentation">What are events? What events do you know?</blockquote>

<p class="alterconf">E.g. click, mouseover, mouseout, etc.</p>

   				<blockquote class="presentation">What is event bubbling? How do you prevent it?</blockquote>

<h4>Programming language-specific questions</h4>

<p class="fifty-percent-left">You need to know well the features of your chosen programming language, or the language required for the position.</p>
<p class="fifty-percent-left">Language-specific questions vary too much, and we can't cover them here, because this preparation series is not language-specific.</p>
<p class="fifty-percent-left">However, there are a few questions that are frequently asked about languages like Java and C#:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="fifty-percent">How is an interface different from an abstract class?</li>
	<li class="fifty-percent">Can an abstract class have methods that are implemented?</li>
	<li class="fifty-percent">Can you instantiate an abstract class?</li>
</ul>

				</section>

				<section><!-- slide 13 -->

<p class="alterconf">Questions that test knowledge of object-oriented programming and design concepts</p>
<ul>
	<li class="fifty-percent">What is inheritance?</li>
	<li class="fifty-percent">What is polymorphism?</li>
	<li class="fifty-percent">What are access modifiers in &lt;your chosen language&gt;? E.g. <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, what else? What is the default access level if you don't specify any, for the class? For the class methods? </li>
	<li class="fifty-percent">What are SOLID principles? </li>
</ul>
				</section>


				<section><!-- slide 13 -->

<h4>Exception handling</h4>

<p class="sixty-percent-left">All the commonly used programming languages have exceptions. Best practices of exception handling are common interview questions.</p>

<p class="sixty-percent-left">Usually exception-handling constructs are something like that:</p>

<pre><code class="presentation-bigger">
try {
	... some code that can possibly throw an exception
}
catch (ExceptionType e) {
	... do something with the exception
}
catch (AnotherExceptionType e) {
	... do something with the exception
}
...
catch (YetAnotherExceptionType e) {
	... do something with the exception
}
finally {
	... some code that gets executed whether or not exception was thrown
}
</code></pre>

<p class="fifty-percent-left">The keywords may be different in different languages. For example, Python has <code>try ... except ... else </code>, Ruby has <code>rescue</code> instead of <code>catch</code>, etc.</p>

				</section>


				<section><!-- slide 13 -->

<h4>Exception handling, continued</h4>

<blockquote class="presentation">A common interview question: if the code in the <code>catch</code> block throws an exception, will the <code>finally</code> block be executed?</blockquote>

<p class="fifty-percent-left">The way to find out is to write a piece of code for this scenario in your language.</p>
<p class="fifty-percent-left">This scenario describes a common situation: if an exception occurs in the <code>try</code> block, the <code>catch</code> block often logs it to a file or a database. What if it can't open the database connection, or the log file doesn't exist? Then an exception will be thrown in the <code>catch</code> block.  </p>
<ul>
<p class="fifty-percent-left">Other exception handling principles:</p>
<p class="fifty-percent-left">Exceptions should be treated as rare, because handling them is computationally costly. Don't use exceptions to handle commonly-occuring scenarios. For example, if a function often returns <code>null</code>, don't make the <code>null</code> value throw an exception. Rather, design your code so that <code>null</code> would be an acceptable value.</p>
<p class="fifty-percent-left">Another example. Your regularly-running script deletes files. Some files' permissions don't let your script delete them. This happens often, and you don't want your script to throw an exception when this occurs. You want it to check if the file's permissions allow deletion, and if not, move on to the next file. However, if your script discovers that the whole directory is missing, it should definitely throw an exception, because it can't work with a nonexistent directory. </p>
